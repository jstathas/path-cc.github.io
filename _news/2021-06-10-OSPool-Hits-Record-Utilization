Researchers utilizing the OSPool are racking up record-breaking numbers. On June 8, the OSPool, which provides computing resources to researchers across the country, went over 1.1 million core hours –– a daily record number. To put this in perspective, one million cores is equivalent to using 42 thousand cores in just one day. That is close to half the size of Expanse, one of the National Science Foundation’s largest funded supercomputing centers. In short, an increasing number of researchers are utilizing the OSG to carry out an incredible amount of computing.  

The people behind these big numbers deserve some recognition. Researchers responsible for piling up these hours include: 

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), an international collaboration capturing the first image of a black hole through the creation of a virtual Earth-sized telescope 
Michigan State University researcher Martin Berz , who conducts simulations of the Muon g-2 Experiment at Fermilab 
Researcher Susanne Pfeifer from Arizona State University investigating genomics and evolution. 

Many other researchers nationwide are tapping into the OSPool and are contributing to the long tail of science. Access to the OSPool is free and open to:
Any researcher affiliated with a project at a US-based academic, government, or non-profit institution 
Any researcher affiliated with an organization that has its own access point (including affiliations outside the US)
All areas of research including social sciences, humanities, life sciences, engineering, medicine, chemistry, and physics.
Who contributes these distributed high-throughput computing resources to support this science? Campuses large and small across the country. From universities like Syracuse, South Dakota State, Purdue, and the University of Connecticut, to organizations like the American Museum of Natural History –– institutions nationwide enable this research.
